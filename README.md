# sphericaltexture_plugin

Bridges [Spherical Textures](https://github.com/KoehlerLab/SphericalTexture) into ilastik. 

Maps each object to a sphere/circle by mean intensity projection, and quantifies the distribution of the intensity signal in the projection through Spherical Harmonics/Fourier decomposition, or exposes polarization direction.
